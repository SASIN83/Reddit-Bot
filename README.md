# Reddit-Bot
This is a Reddit-Bot made with Python using PRAW API to automatically comment, under Subreddit 'test, Chuck Norris Jokes using ICnDB API on my posts if word "Joke" is present in the sentence of comment.

Before cloning this repository I want you to make sure that you know how to make Reddit environment to get Secret and ID from Reddit.

Steps to get Secret and ID from Reddit:
  1. Visit www.reddit.com/prefs/apps and then create app.
  2. Make sure that you select Script as option while creating app.
  3. The code under the Name of your app after you have created it is the ID.
  4. The code along side the secret is the Secret.
  
The ID and Secret are most important asset to use the bot. You will enter the ID and Secret in the code to login and Bot to work.

Tips:
  1. If you want bot to work on the other Subreddit than 'tests' then just replace 'tests'  from all over the code and change it to the Subreddit you want to work with.
  
  2. In this bot I have just limited my bot to read 10 comments at time and sleep 10 seconds after that, but you can increase the limit and sleep time, but be sure that the limit      or time is not so large that Reddit Spam you temporarily or permanently.

If Anything happens to your bot or account I am not responsible for your loss so be sure that you don't play with code illegally or in such a way that it causes you or someone else any digital harm.
